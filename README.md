# redux-example
Just trying to solve some of my problems with flux using redux

## WARNING

This example uses a modified version of the `sovereign` module because the way
`redux` adds listeners is different than most flux libraries.  I'll be publishing a
new version that supports `redux` through a config option "soon-ish".
